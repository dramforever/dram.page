</div>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The research that went into this article began as a simple technical
question: How do I connect to the JTAG debug port on the VisionFive?</p>
<p>When luojia <a
href="https://forum.rvspace.org/t/jtag-visionfive/354">asked this very
question</a> on the support forum, the only responses were,
surprisingly, discouragement. However, for any low-level software
development, such a debug port is pretty much the only way to sanely,
well, debug anything at all. Even though <code>printf</code> debugging
was technically possible, it is still worth it to see if we can reach it
over JTAG, given that the board is supposed to have JTAG connectors.</p>
<h2 id="visionfive">VisionFive</h2>
<p>The development board in question, <a
href="https://rvspace.org/en/Product/VisionFive/Technical_Documents/VisionFive_Single_Board_Computer_Quick_Start_Guide">VisionFive</a>,
is a RISC-V single-board computer from StarFive. At its core is a
StarFive JH7100 SoC, with two SiFive U74 cores and one E24 core.</p>
<p><em>(As of writing, the version of VisionFive currently available is
also known as ‘VisionFive V1’, though even official documentation often
omits the version number. The name ‘VisionFive’ in this article
consistently refers to VisionFive V1, in case confusion arises in the
future.)</em></p>
<p>The same processor core is also found on the <a
href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unmatched">HiFive
Unmatched</a>, on which the main SoC has four U74 cores and one S7 core.
Unmatched had more RAM and better peripherals, and was made in the form
factor of a regular PC motherboard. VisionFive is, instead, clearly
intended for a slightly lower end market, or for those who prefers a
palm-sized Raspberry Pi lookalike.</p>
<h2 id="jtag-on-the-visionfive-or-not">JTAG on the VisionFive, or
not</h2>
<p>For our purposes, the one main difference between the Unmatched and
the VisionFive is how the JTAG port is connected. On the Unmatched, an
FT2322H adapter on-board means that the Micro-USB port gives access to
both the UART port and the JTAG port, readily usable with <a
href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-openocd">riscv-openocd</a>.</p>
<p>On the VisionFive, however, JTAG access seems… elusive. Nowhere in
the documentation is the JTAG port on-board mentioned. On drawings of
the board, the words JTAG are written next to the PMIC, which is, at
least to me, nonsensical, as there are no notable ports to be found
there.</p>

<p>Next to the color-coded (nice!) 40-pin header though, one can find
seven plated holes, one of them having a square outline. Browsing
through the schematic reveals that this is indeed where the JTAG port is
connected.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Problem solved, right? Solder up some header pins or build a pogo-pin
rig, and just connect it up to your workstation with an FT2322H, and we
have JTAG.</p>
<p>Or so we thought. Unfortunately, this JTAG ports does not seem to
respond at all to any input. It seems as if this port isn’t connected at
all.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-jtag-port">Finding the JTAG port</h2>
<p>Chasing through labels on the schematics reveals that the
<code>JTAG_*</code> through-holes connect to a level shifter, which
presents the SoC with 1.8 V signals instead of 3.3 V ones. They then
connect to pads on the SoC, mysteriously named
<code>GPIOxx/U74_JTAG_*</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/sch-jtag-soc.png" alt="JTAG connections to the SOC" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">JTAG connections to the SOC</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So are these GPIO or JTAG? Thankfully the pad connections have labels
with positions, so we can look them up on the datasheet. For example,
<code>A25</code> is described as…</p>
<pre><code>A25     GPIO[0]     IO      function IO share with GPIO</code></pre>
<p>‘Function IO Share’ is the title of section 11 in the datasheet. One
register, named <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>, has one of 7 valid values,
0 through 6, is a global configuration controlling the functions
two-hundred-odd pads <code>PAD_FUNC_SHARE[141:0]</code> and
<code>PAD_GPIO[63:0]</code>. Each of the configurations is called a
‘signal group’, and the groups themselves are called ‘Function 0’
through ‘Function 7’. A giant table then follows, showing each pad’s
function under each signal group.</p>
<p>The pads <code>PAD_GPIO[4:0]</code> would be the connections we found
earlier, and in Function 0, they. Since Function 0 is supposed to be the
default value on reset, this means that we should see a JTAG port there,
right?</p>
<p>At this point, the only thing I could think of is connecting to JTAG
while holding down the reset button. However, since I had neither a JTAG
adapter nor a VisionFive board, all I did was tell luojia about it, and
moved on to finish my finals.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-into-the-gpio-multiplexer">Digging deeper into
the GPIO multiplexer</h2>
<p>The single document that made the system ‘click’ for me is the
devicetree documentation for <code>starfive,jh7100-pinctrl</code>. This
node can be found in <code>jh7100.dtsi</code>, which is included in
<code>jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dts</code>:</p>
<pre class="dts"><code>gpio: pinctrl@11910000 {
    compatible = &quot;starfive,jh7100-pinctrl&quot;;
    reg = &lt;0x0 0x11910000 0x0 0x10000&gt;,
          &lt;0x0 0x11858000 0x0 0x1000&gt;;
    reg-names = &quot;gpio&quot;, &quot;padctl&quot;;
    /* &lt;snip&gt; */
};</code></pre>
<p>The address ranges mentioned here correspond to these rows in the
datasheet:</p>
<pre><code>SYSCTRL-IOPAD_CTRL  0x00_1185_8000  0x00_1185_BFFF  16KB
GPIO                0x00_1191_0000  0x00_1191_FFFF  64KB</code></pre>
<p>These registers control the functions and states of
<code>PAD_GPIO[63:0]</code> and <code>PAD_FUNC_SHARE[141:0]</code>. The
following diagram is included in the devicetree bindings
documentation:</p>
<pre><code>                          Signal group 0, 1, ... or 6

    UART0     UART1 --</code></pre>
<p>These pads on the package, or ‘function IO share with GPIO’ as listed
in the datasheet, are connected to the internal signals through a
<em>two</em>-stage multiplexer:</p>
<p>First, as mentioned, the <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> register
selects one of 7 ‘signal groups’. This is, curiously, a global setting,
meaning that it affects <em>all</em> of the ‘function share’ pads at
once. A huge table in the datasheet describes the function of each such
pad’s function in each signal group. For example, the row in the table
for <code>PAG_GPIO[0]</code> reads: (Reproduced here vertically for
convenience)</p>
<pre><code>Interface               GPIO
IO Name                 PAD_GPIO[0]
Function 0 (Default)    U74_JTAG_TDO
Function 1              GPIO0
Function 2              X2C_TX_DATA3
Function 3              LCD_DATA4
Function 4              X2C_TX_DATA3
Function 5              PLL_RFSLIP[0]
Function 6              MIPITX_MPOSV[0]</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>GPIOn</code> has no direct correspondence to
<code>PAD_GPIO[n]</code>. For example, <code>PAD_FUNC_SHARE[0]</code>
can also be connected to <code>GPIO0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Interface               ChipLink
IO Name                 PAD_FUNC_SHARE[0]
Function 0 (Default)    X2C_TX_CLK
Function 1              LCD_CLK
Function 2              CM_CLK
Function 3              X2C_TX_CLK
Function 4              GPIO0
Function 5              GPIO0
Function 6              GPIO0</code></pre>
<p>Instead, <code>GPIOn</code> are internal signals further multiplexed
into internal inputs and outputs by the ‘GPIO FMUX’. Each of the
<code>GPIOn</code> signals also has configurable pull up/down and
Schmitt triggers, though not all options are available for all I/O
pads.</p>
<p>After that, there are three connections to be made: output, output
enable, and input. These are all configured from the destination side,
so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each GPIO output and output enable may be connected to either one of
the internal outputs or a constant <code>0</code> or
<code>1</code>.</li>
<li>Each internal input may be connected to one of the GPIO inputs, or a
constant <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the input value from each GPIO may be read from MMIO
registers <code>GPIODIN_0</code> and <code>GPIODIN_1</code>, and it’s
also possible to configure them to fire interrupts.</p>
<p>This allows quite a flexible usage of the GPIO internal signals. They
can be selected to work with the 1.8 V or 3.3 V I/O pads, and can either
be fully controlled by software with interrupt support, or connected to
one of the internal I2C/I2S/SDIO/… controllers.</p>
<p>Curiously, in Function 0, the default mode for
<code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>, <em>none</em> of the GPIOn signals are
connected to the I/O pads. Instead, some of the internal signals are
directly connected to I/O pads. Moreover, in a few of the cases, the
internal signals <code>PAD_GPIO[n]</code> connects to in Function 0 are
conveniently also by default connected to the same-numbered internal
<code>GPIOn</code>. For example, most relevant to our original use
cases, in Function 0 these connections are made:</p>
<pre><code>PAD_GPIO[0]         U74_JTAG_TDO
PAD_GPIO[1]         U74_JTAG_TCK
PAD_GPIO[2]         U74_JTAG_TDI
PAD_GPIO[3]         U74_JTAG_TMS
PAD_GPIO[4]         U74_JTAG_TRSTN</code></pre>
<p>At the same time, the default GPIO FMUX configuration for these JTAG
signals are:</p>
<pre><code>CPU_JTAG_TDO        GPIO0
CPU_JTAG_TCK        GPIO1
CPU_JTAG_TDI        GPIO2
CPU_JTAG_TMS        GPIO3
CPU_JTAG_TRSTN      GPIO4</code></pre>
<p>(It seems that <code>CPU_JTAG_*</code> are synonymous with
<code>U74_JTAG_*</code>.)</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-jtag-port-take-two">Finding the JTAG port, take
two</h2>
<p>It seems that Function 0 is intended for booting and initialization,
with many of the internal functions available on I/O pads right away
without configuration. However given the lack of, well, actual general
purpose input/output, there is no chance Linux runs in Function 0.</p>
<p>We already see our problem: The seven through-holes going to
<code>PAD_GPIO[4:0]</code> are JTAG in Function 0 but might not be when
another ‘Function’ is selected. This means that at some time after
booting, <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> is set from <code>0</code> to some
other value, and these JTAG-appearing through-holes would no longer be
JTAG.</p>
<p>Which value is it then? Curiously, the example listed in the
devicetree documentation has this property:</p>
<pre><code>starfive,signal-group = &lt;6&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>Which would suggest that Linux selects Function 6 at initialization,
though the actual <code>jh7100.dtsi</code> did not have this property.
The documentation indicates that in case the property is not specified,
the <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> register is left unchanged:</p>

<p>After a short chat with luojia, who tried connecting to JTAG without
a microSD card unsuccessfully, it is apparent that some earlier boot
stage sets <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>. It did not take long crawling
through the code provided by StarFive to find <a
href="https://github.com/starfive-tech/JH7100_secondBoot/blob/bootloader-211102_VisionFive_JH7100/boot/bootmain.c#L179">this
particular line in secondBoot</a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>_SET_SYSCON_REG_register104_SCFG_io_padshare_sel<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">6</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For those not familiar with secondBoot, it is one of the first stages
of bootloaders on the VisionFive, second to only the internal ROM.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/boot-flow.png" alt="VisionFive boot flow" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">VisionFive boot flow</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All of the ‘Firmware’ stages run from an on-board QSPI flash, without
requiring a microSD card present. This means that early on in the boot
sequence, <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> is switched from <code>0</code>
to <code>6</code>, disabling the JTAG through-holes. Searching through
the other files in this repository also reveals the undocumented address
of <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>:</p>
<pre><code>0x118581a0</code></pre>
<p>There is still a way to confirm <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>. If you
hold down the ‘Boot mode’ button while powering the board up, instead of
following the normal boot process, a prompt appears on the ‘debug’
serial console port at 9600 8n1, running off internal ROM, where you can
read and write arbitrary physical memory. At this point, NickCao helped
me out by connecting to this ‘recovery console’, and reading
<code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code>:</p>
<pre><code># rh 0x118581a0

 Read Half : 0x0000</code></pre>
<p>Reading the same address in the U-Boot shell gives <code>6</code>,
confirming much of what we had seen.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-jtag-for-the-first-time">Connecting to JTAG, for
the first time</h2>
<p>But wait, if <code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> is <code>0</code> when
running in internal ROM, does this mean JTAG <em>is</em> available on
the seven through-holes? Should we be able to connect to the debug
modules in this state?</p>
<p>I asked Icenowy, the only person I know of with both a VisionFive and
some JTAG adapter handy to help out. I told them to power up the board
with ‘Boot mode’ button held down, and <em>then</em> try connecting to
JTAG. They came back with what was, at the time of writing, the first
screenshot of GDB-over-OpenOCD connected to the JH7100, at least from
what I could find on the Internet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/gdb-connected.jpg" alt="Connected to GDB, yay!" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Connected to GDB, yay!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among the addresses found in the registers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x1840084c</code>: Middle of internal ROM</li>
<li><code>0x1800ff80</code>: Middle of intRAM0</li>
<li><code>0x1244000c</code>: One of the UART3 registers</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we have JTAG access to the VisionFive.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-jtag-port-take-three">Finding the JTAG port, take
three</h2>
<p>Even though technically we’re connected to the debug module, running
the SoC entirely in Function 0 isn’t really an option as the board
doesn’t seem to be configured this way. Once we switch to Function 6
though, our connection would be cut off.</p>
<p>Where do the JTAG signals now go go? As mentioned earlier, the JTAG
signals are mapped by default to <code>GPIO0</code> through
<code>GPIO4</code>. Since we’re now in Function 6, these GPIO signals
correspond to I/O pads… (looks at datasheet)
<code>PAD_FUNC_SHARE[4:0]</code>, which are 3.3 V and connected on the
schematic to nets confusingly named <code>GPIO0</code> through
<code>GPIO4</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/sch-func-share.png"
alt="Nets GPIOn on the schematic" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Nets GPIOn on the schematic</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These nets are connected to the 40-pin Raspberry Pi compatible header
at pins… Wait what?</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/sch-jtag-pi-connector.png"
alt="Nets GPIOn connected to the Raspberry Pi header" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Nets GPIOn connected to the Raspberry Pi
header</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For some reason, these pins are labelled on the schematic with JTAG
signal names. On any other documentation, such as <a
href="https://rvspace.org/Product/General/StarFive_40-Pin_GPIO_Header_User_Guide">StarFive’s
GPIO Header Guide</a>, they are only referred to as <code>GPIO0</code>,
etc. and nowhere is JTAG mentioned.</p>
<p>A straightforward test of connecting the JTAG adapter while the
system is up and running showed that these five pins… do not respond to
the JTAG adapter.</p>
<p>Confusingly, Icenowy found out that for a certain period during the
boot process, they <em>could</em> connect through those pins on the
40-pin header. Before this period, JTAG is found on the seven
through-holes, and after that, it just seems to… disappear. Perhaps
somewhere in the boot process another piece of code configured the
second-stage GPIO FMUX and disconnected the JTAG signals. It makes sense
because it frees up five pins on the header for actual GPIO.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-jtag-port-take-four">Finding the JTAG port, take
four</h2>
<p>Around the same time when I asked NickCao to confirm the value of
<code>IO_PADSHARE_SEL</code> in U-Boot, I also asked them to check the
GPIO FMUX configuration, which showed that JTAG signals are connected
correctly to <code>GPIO0</code> through <code>GPIO4</code>. Therefore,
whatever changed the configuration must have come after. Linux it
is.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the devicetree node
<code>starfive,jh7100-pinctrl</code> manages both layers of GPIO
multiplexing. The driver itself can be found in
<code>drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-starfive.c</code>.</p>
<p>Initially, I had assumed that the driver in StarFive’s fork of Linux
was identical to that found in mainline Linux 5.18, though I would soon
be proven wrong. As I was browsing through the dts files hoping to gain
some insight on why the JTAG signals were gone, a section in
<code>jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dts</code> caught my eye.</p>
<pre class="dts"><code>&amp;gpio {
    /* don&#39;t reset gpio mux for serial console and reset gpio */
    starfive,keep-gpiomux = &lt;13 14 63&gt;;
};</code></pre>
<p>There was no mention of <code>starfive,keep-gpiomux</code> in
mainline Linux’s version of <code>pinctrl-starfive</code>, but these two
lines in StarFive’s version seemed relevant.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(!</span>keepmux<span class="op">)</span></span>

<p><code>keepmux</code> is a module option defined as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">bool</span> keepmux<span class="op">;</span></span>

<p><code>starfive_pinmux_reset</code> disables the inputs and outputs
associated with every <code>GPIOn</code> signal, unless <code>n</code>
was mentioned in <code>starfive,keep-gpiomux</code>.</p>
<p>The next step was clear: Boot with the kernel command line option
<code>pinctrl-starfive.keepmux=1</code>, or modify

with OpenOCD</h2>
<p>At this point I borrowed the board from NickCao, and used a Raspberry
Pi as an adapter to connect to it, over the JTAG pins on the 40-pin
connector. Two TAPs can be found on the JTAG port, the first of which
connects to the E24 core, and the second connects to the two U74 cores.
This was my OpenOCD configuration file:</p>

<p>Before Linux boots, I was able to connect to all of these cores, and
read some information off of them. For example, reading CSRs from the
U74 cores:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/gdb-read-csr.png" alt="Reading some CSRs over GDB" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Reading some CSRs over GDB</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As expected, this is a SiFive (<code>mvendorid = 0x489</code>)
7-series (<code>marchid = (1 &lt;&lt; 63) | 7</code>) core, version
19.05 (<code>mimpid = 0x20190531</code>). Seen from the ISA implemented,
namely <code>RV64GC</code> with Supervisor/User, this was certainly a
U74 core.</p>
<p>After Linux starts, however, the E24 core seems to start misbehaving.
OpenOCD starts generating error messages like:</p>
<pre><code>Warn : target e24.cpu0 examination failed
Error: [e24.cpu0] DMI operation didn&#39;t complete in 2 seconds. The target is either really slow or broken. You could increase the timeout with riscv set_command_timeout_sec.</code></pre>
<p>It seems that the E24 core had been disconnected or disabled. In any
case, it was not responding. OpenOCD was confused by this lack of
response and debugging on the U74 was also affected:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/gdb-errors.png"
alt="GDB errors due to E24 not responding" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">GDB errors due to E24 not
responding</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Commenting out the <code>e24.cpu0</code> line in the config would
ignore the E24 core and work around this issue.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre
class="sourceCode tcl"><code class="sourceCode tcl"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># target create e24.cpu0 riscv -chain-position e24.cpu -coreid 0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What is going on with the E24 core? Seeing that the main star of the
show, the dual U74 cores, have already been ‘conquered’, it’s probably
an appropriate time to take a break. This article has already been
filled with too many details, so we will look at the E24
‘microcontroller’ core next time, as a side quest, in a future post.</p>
<p>(By the way: It seems that beta/sample versions of the now cancelled
BeagleV Starlight board has a very similar JTAG configuration. If anyone
still has one of these boards, it would be extremely interesting to try
it out.)</p>
